Q. String []strng = new String[]{"abc","xyz","abcxyz"};
Select the correct option to print only the string elements that contains "xyz"?
1). Stream<String>stream = Arrays.stream(strng);
  stream.filter(str->str.contains("xyz")).forEach(strn->System.out.println(strn));
2). Stream<String>stream = Arrays.stream(strng);
  stream.distinct(str->str.contains("xyz")).forEach(strn->System.out.println(strn));
3). System.out.println(stream.allMatch(str1->str1.contains("xyz")));
4). System.out.println(stream.anyMatch(str1->str1.contains("xyz")));
Solution :
option [1] is correct
Attempted :
option [2] is attempted


Q. @FunctionalInterface
interface Power
{
 public int calculatePower(int base,int index);
}
public class CalculatePowerDemo{

 public static void main(String[] args) {
int x=4,y=2;
}
}How to call calculatePower() in CalculatePowerDemo class?
1). Class CalculatePowerDemo need to implement Power interface and has to override calculatePower() to call it
2). It can be implemented as given below
Power pwr = (base,index)->{for(int i=0;i<index;i++)
  {
    base = base*index;
  }
  return base;};
  result= pwr.calculatePower(x, y);
  System.out.println(result);
3). It can be implemented as given below
Power pwr = (base,index)->{for(int i=0;i<index;i++)
  {
    base = base*index;
  }
  };
  result= pwr.calculatePower(x, y);
  System.out.println(result);
4). It can be implemented as given below
System.out.println((base,index)->{for(int i=0;i<index;i++)
  {
    base = base*index;
  }
  return base;};)
Solution :
option [2] is correct
Attempted :
option [3] is attempted
